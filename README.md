Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting older adults, characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and reduced quality of life. The early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease is crucial, as it enables timely intervention, which can improve patient outcomes and slow disease progression. Traditional diagnostic methods, though effective, often require extensive clinical evaluations and can be both time-consuming and costly. To address this, recent advancements in artificial intelligence, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promise in analysing neuroimaging data for automated Alzheimer’s detection.
This study explores the application of CNNs to accurately classify brain MRI images, differentiating between healthy and Alzheimer's-affected brains. Using a dataset developed in the UCS 1603 Introduction to Machine Learning Course, which includes 6,400 images categorized into four levels of cognitive impairment, our approach leverages CNN architectures optimized for extracting intricate features from neuroimaging data. The methodology encompasses essential stages such as data pre-processing, model architecture selection, training, and validation. Techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning are applied to improve model robustness and enhance classification accuracy.
The proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of 89.65%, an F1 score of 0.8938, and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity across different classes. These results highlight the model’s potential for reliable early-stage detection of Alzheimer’s disease, positioning it as a viable diagnostic tool for integration into healthcare systems. Our research not only contributes to machine learning and medical imaging but also underscores the significance of AI-driven diagnostics in advancing healthcare accessibility and effectiveness for Alzheimer's patients.
